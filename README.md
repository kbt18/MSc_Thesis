# Code for my MSc thesis

Accompanying project report to come shortly.

This code runs a spiking neural network in the BRIAN neural network simulator and classifies the MNIST or Fashion-MNIST datasets using the trained weights in `/weights`.

#Usage:
To classify the MNIST dataset run:
`python network.py`

To analyse the results run:
`python spike_analysis.py`
